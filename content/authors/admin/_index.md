I am a PhD student at the UNBC [Freshwater Fish Ecology lab](https://www.ffishlab.ca/). We are using many years of acoustic telemetry data and Bayesian models to make inferences about White Sturgeon movement in the Columbia River. More generally, I am interested in all things R, spatial data/maps, database design and (interactive) data visualization.
